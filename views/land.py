## Overview
SafeInCave is a 3D finite element simulator based on FEniCSx. It is designed to simulate the mechanical behavior of salt caverns under different operational conditions.

---

## Key Features

- **MPI-powered parallelism**: Scale simulations efficiently with mpi4py for distributed computing
- **Thermal effects**: Solve heat diffusion equation and include thermal strains and creep thermal responses
- **Cyclic operations**: Impose fast cyclic pressure loads to the cavern walls
- **Constitutive model**: Include transient creep, reverse transient creep, and steady-state creep
- **Robust linearization**: Provides robustness and flexibility to include new constitutive models
- **Time discretization**: Choose between Explicit, Crank-Nicolson, and Fully-Implicit schemes
- **XDMF output**: Efficient output format in terms of size and postprocessing

## Getting started
The user should start by reading the documentation at folder docs/manual. There you will find the installation steps, simple to complex tutorials, and detailed instructions on how to setup your own simulation cases. In addition, check out our video lectures on the SafeInCave simulator:

1) Tensorial operations (theory): https://youtu.be/w5KX3F_rdzU?si=QQLVBq1NcrvOiS32
2) Tensorial operations (exercises): https://youtu.be/JiN6jwp0RPk?si=K1Qhe3lAxJD4LI5w
3) Constitutive modeling: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCeJIbjIL10
4) Stay tuned for upcoming video lectures.
